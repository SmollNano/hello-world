# hello-world
A repo where I store and collect ideas for projects.

Also an introduction, I guess.
I'm Kalie, a computational linguistics student from Europe. 
Currently I'm not really using github much, but I'm hoping that'll change with time (and experience).
I enjoy reading Supercorp fanfics, reading in general, playing games and drawing.
