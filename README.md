# hello-world
A repo where I store and collect ideas for projects.

I'm supposed to write a bit about myself, so here goes...
My Username is Pikku Kissa, which is Finnish for little cat.
I'm not from Finland though, I'm just learning the language and really enjoy it so far.
I "speak" some Python, C, C# and Java.
